        <p class="topic"> Jaden Smith Fanpage:</p>
        <li class= "portfoliofont"> I decided to create a fan page over a famous artist/poet/actor named Jaden Smith. I am really inspired by his work and wanted to make a place where people could get an overview of who he is.

        <p class="topic"> Luis's Buzzfeed quiz:</p>
        <li class= "portfoliofont"> After the first episode I was completely obssesed over the show "The Office" because of the characters and the comedy they are able to pull off as a whole. I decided to use my knowledge on certain characters to create a buzzfeed quiz to find out which character would you be in that show.

        <p class="topic"> Luis's Playlist:</p>
        <li class= "portfoliofont"> I really love spotfy and the simplicity it is to use it! I decided to create a version of spotify of my own and contain a list of my favorite songs(this project I may actually end up using to listen to my music).
